# Gear Generator

Gear Generator is a Python-based application that allows users to create and visualize spur gears with a specified number of teeth and pitch radius. The application generates a two-dimensional view of the gear and displays the involute gear tooth profile.

## Features

- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple GUI to input gear parameters.
- **Customizable Gear Parameters**: Ability to define the number of teeth and pitch radius.
- **Visualization**: Graphical display of the gear with involute tooth profiles using Matplotlib.
- **Animation**: Option to animate the gear to visualize its rotation (future implementation).
- **Export Options**: Functionality to save the gear design as an image file (future implementation may include DXF or SVG formats).

## Installation

Ensure that you have Python 3.x installed on your system. You can download Python from the official website: [https://www.python.org](https://www.python.org).

After installing Python, you need to install the required libraries. Open your terminal or command prompt and run the following command:

```sh
pip install matplotlib tk
