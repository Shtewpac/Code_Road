detect_rank_and_suit_v6_pixel_screen.py is designed to automate the detection and comparison of poker hands from a screenshot or video feed of a poker game, likely captured from a virtual table. It utilizes OpenCV for image processing, mss for screen capture, PyGetWindow to target specific application windows, and the Google Cloud Vision API for optical character recognition (OCR).

Here’s a breakdown of how the original script functions:

1. **Imports and Constants:** Key libraries are imported and constants for image processing (threshold values, image dimensions, etc.) are defined.

2. **Custom Classes and Methods:**
   - `Query_card` class: Represents a playing card from the video feed/screenshots, storing detected contours, image of card's rank and suit, and computed properties like best rank and suit matches.
   - `ImageProcessor` class: Contains static methods for image operations like resizing, cropping, capturing the screen of a specific window, loading images from disk, and detecting large contours to focus on specific sections of the image (e.g., where cards are).
   - `CardDetector` class: For loading and handling predefined images of card ranks and suits for comparison.
   - `Train_ranks` and `Train_suits` classes: Stores loaded images of card ranks and suits from files for matching purposes.

3. **Detection Logic:** Cards on the screen are located using predefined bounding boxes, then cropped out of the screenshot for processing. Images are then converted to grayscale, blurred, and thresholded to prepare for contour detection, allowing extraction and comparison with known card ranks and suits.

4. **Card Comparison:** After extraction, the ranks and suits of the cards are determined using comparison against predefined rank and suit images. If the script can't confidently identify a card, OCR via Google Cloud Vision may be used as a fallback.

5. **Hand Comparison:** The identified cards are converted to a format allowing poker hand assessment. The script evaluates which of two player hands has a superior poker hand combination.

6. **Output:** Visual feedback is provided by marking the winning hand directly on the screenshot. Continuous image feed handling is possible, allowing real-time updating of the analysis as the hands on the displayed game change.

7. **Main Loop:** The primary function orchestrates taking an application screenshot, identifying cards, comparing poker hands, and outputting the result. Image resizing and cropping are applied to standardize input dimensions for consistent detection.

This script is powerful for analyzing online poker games by providing an automated way to log and compare hands, potentially useful for building poker training tools or live game analysis apps. It combines image processing techniques with traditional card game logic to bridge computer vision and game strategy analysis.


Recreating the project from scratch would require a well-organized codebase to enhance maintainability, scalability, and collaboration. Below is an improved directory structure and codebase organization to efficiently manage the various functionalities of the poker hand detection and comparison system:

### Codebase Organization

1. **Main Application (`main.py`)**: Serves as the entry point of the application, orchestrating the capture of screen images, detection of cards, analysis of poker hands, and display/update of results.

2. **Configuration (`config.py`)**: Central file for managing configurations such as image capture settings, image processing thresholds, and paths to asset directories.

3. **Card Detection Module (`card_detection/`)**:
   - `detector.py`: Handles the logic for finding cards in images using contours and template matching.
   - `processor.py`: Contains image processing operations such as resizing, cropping, rotating images, and applying filters.
   - `structures.py`: Defines data structures (`Query_card`, `Train_ranks`, `Train_suits`) to facilitate storing card information for processing and matching.

4. **Hand Analysis Module (`hand_analysis/`)**:
   - `evaluator.py`: Contains the rules and logic to evaluate and compare different poker hands, identifying the best hand based on the cards detected.
   - `models.py`: Includes classes like `Card`, `HandType`, and other poker-specific models for easier management of game entities.

5. **Utility Functions (`utils/`)**:
   - `image_utils.py`: General-purpose image utilities not specific to poker.
   - `adb_utils.py`: Specific utilities for handling Android Debug Bridge (ADB) interactions, if needed for capturing game screens from connected Android devices.

6. **Assets (`assets/`)**: Contains static files, notably images used for template matching. This structure facilitates updates and scaling when new card styles or types are introduced.

7. **Tests (`tests/`)**: Contains tests divided into modules corresponding to application parts. These tests ensure that individual components function correctly and adhere to the project requirements.

### Implementation Notes:
- **Modularity:** Breaking down the application into separate modules (like card detection and hand analysis) allows more manageable development, debugging, and scaling.
- **Testing:** Providing extensive testing ensures reliability and eases further integration as new poker games or card styles may be added.
- **Documentation:** Aside from `README.md`, comprehensive in-line comments and API documentation using tools like Sphinx should be maintained.

By adhering to these structures and practices, the project will be well-positioned for robustness and future extensions, be it adding new card games or deploying as a service.
