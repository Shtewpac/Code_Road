# Project Overview

This project focuses on organizing and summarizing directories and files using OpenAI's API capabilities. Several versions of the `dir_organizer` script have been implemented, each improving on various aspects such as error handling, file summarization, and API cost efficiency.

## File Versions

- **dir_organizer_V1.py**: Sets up a predefined directory structure for the project and relocates and renames existing files.
- **dir_organizer_V2_dir_summary.py**: Improves file handling, error management, and logic for moving/renaming files.
- **dir_organizer_V3_multi_file_handling copy.py**: Adds multi-file handling and conflict management.
- **dir_organizer_V4_full_file_summary.py**: Refines summarizing and structuring of multiple files.
- **dir_organizer_V5_generate_dir_structure.py**: Focuses on generating new directory structures.
- **dir_organizer_V6_refactor.py**: Consolidates improvements and refactors for readability and performance.
- **dir_organizer_V7_cheaper.py**: Achieves cost efficiency and optimizes summarization processes.
